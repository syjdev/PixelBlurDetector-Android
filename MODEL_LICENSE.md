# Model License & Provenance

This document covers the **machine-learning model artifact** in this repository. It is licensed
**separately** from the source code.

| Artifact | Path |
|---|---|
| TensorFlow Lite model (float) | `pixel-blur-detector/src/main/assets/blur_segmentation_float.tflite` |

> The **source code** in this repository is licensed under **Apache-2.0** (see
> [`LICENSE`](LICENSE)). The Apache-2.0 license does **not** apply to the model artifact listed
> above.

## Training data

The model was trained on two academic datasets:

1. **CUHK Blur Detection Dataset**
   (J. Shi, L. Xu, J. Jia, *"Discriminative Blur Detection Features"*, CVPR 2014)
   <http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~leojia/projects/dblurdetect/dataset.html>
2. **DUT-DBD Dataset**
   (W. Zhao, F. Zhao, D. Wang, H. Lu, *"Defocus Blur Detection via Multi-stream Bottom-Top-Bottom
   Fully Convolutional Network"*, CVPR 2018)
   <https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/html/Zhao_Defocus_Blur_Detection_CVPR_2018_paper.html>

## Current status: license unclear, non-commercial for now ⚠️

**Neither dataset states a license.** As of October 2026:

- The CUHK dataset page describes the data and links the downloads, but gives no license, terms of
  use or statement about commercial use.
- The original DUT-DBD project page (`ice.dlut.edu.cn/ZhaoWenda/BTBCRLNet.html`) is no longer
  reachable, and no license for the dataset has been found elsewhere.

Without a license, we can't confirm that commercial use of these datasets, or of models trained on
them, is allowed. Whether trained model weights are a derivative work of their training data is
also legally unsettled. Until this is resolved:

- The model artifact is offered for **research and non-commercial use only**.
- **Do not ship it in a commercial or closed-source application.**
- If you want to use it commercially, **contact the authors of both datasets first.**
  Permission for one dataset alone is not enough, because the model was trained on both.

This is a conservative, good-faith position, **not legal advice**.

## Making the model commercially usable

One of the following must happen first:

1. **Get written permission** from the authors of **both** the CUHK and DUT-DBD datasets for
   commercial use of models trained on them, and record it here (and in `NOTICE`).
2. **Retrain** the model on data whose license allows commercial use (or on self-collected data),
   and replace the artifact above.

Until then, only the **Apache-2.0 source code** can be reused commercially, not the bundled model.

## Images

The repository contains no images from the datasets above. They affect **only the trained model
weights**.
